Isotopomers
===========

We define an isotopomer as an isolated spin-system
containing multiple sites and couplings between them, weighted by the abundance
of the isotopomer in the ensamble of isotopomers.

We utilizes JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization as a lightweight
exchange of the isotopomers.

and list to construct various
objects required in simulating an NMR spectrum.
Below is a detail description of these objects.
