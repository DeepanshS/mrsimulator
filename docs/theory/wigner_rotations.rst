Tensor Rotation
---------------

At the end of the :ref:`previous section <frequency_tensor_theory>`, we list
various frequency tensors, :math:`\varpi_{L, n}^{(k)}(i,j)`, arising
from the perturbation expansion of NMR Hamiltonian in the principal axis
system (PAS) of the respective interaction tensor. In this section, we focus on
describing the rotation of these frequency tensor from the principal axis
system to the observable scalar frequency in the lab frame. Recall, that the
frequency tensor in PAS, :math:`\varpi_{L, n}^{(k)}(i,j)`, is generically
expressed as,

.. math::

    \varpi_{L, n}^{(k)}(i,j) = \varrho_{L,n}^{(k)}~~\xi_L^{(k)}(i, j).
    :label: eq_8

In terms of the matrix notation, the above equation may also be represented as

.. math::

    \boldsymbol{\varpi}_{L}^{(k)}(i,j) = \boldsymbol{\varrho}_{L}^{(k)}~~\xi_L^{(k)}(i, j).
    :label: eq_9

where the bold face variables are column vectors of length :math:`2L+1` and
:math:`\xi_L^{(k)}(i, j)` is a scalar quantity.
