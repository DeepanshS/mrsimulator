Understanding Isotopomers
*************************

Malcolm H. Levitt defines isotopomers, in his book "Spin Dynamics", as

    "Molecules differing only in the mass numbers of the nuclei are called
    isotopomer."

This definition is good when dealing with molecules. In solid state NMR,
however, one usually. Therefore, we redefine isotopomers as
