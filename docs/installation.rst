Requirements
------------

``mrsimulator`` has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ 3.6 or later
- `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_ 1.16.0 or later

See :ref:`requirements` for a full list of package dependencies.

Make sure you have the required version of python by typing the following in the
terminal,

.. code-block:: shell

      $ python --version

For `Mac` users, python version 3 is installed under the name `python3`. You may replace
`python` for `python3` in the above command and all subsequent python statements.

For `Windows` users, we recommend the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/>`_
or `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ distribution of
python>3.6. Anaconda distribution for python comes with popular python packages that
are frequently used in scientific computing.
Miniconda is a minimal installer for conda. It is a smaller version of Anaconda that
includes conda, Python, and the packages they depend on, along with other useful
packages such as pip. You can find more information under the Windows tab in the
section :ref:`on_local_machine`.

  If you do not have python or have an older version of python, you may visit the
  `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or
  `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/>`_ websites and follow their
  instructions on how to install python.

.. We recommend installing `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_
.. distribution for python version 3.6 or higher. The anaconda distribution
.. ships with numerous packages and modules including Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib
.. which are useful packages for scientific datasets.

and higher. PIP is the easiest way to install python packages.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Linux

    For Linux users, we provide the binary distributions of the mrsimulator package for
    python versions 3.6-3.8. Install the package using pip as follows,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install mrsimulator

  .. tab:: Mac OSX

    For `Mac` users, we provide the binary distributions of the mrsimulator package for
    python versions 3.6-3.8. Install the package using pip as follows,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install mrsimulator

    If the above statement didn't work, you are probably using mac OS system python, in
    which case, use the following,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ python3 -m pip install mrsimulator --user

  .. tab:: Windows

    .. note:: We currently do not provide binary distributions for windows. You'll need
        to compile and build the mrsimulator library. Follow the instructions below.

    .. include:: install-docs/windows.rst

    **Build and install the package**.

    From within the ``Anaconda Prompt``, build and install the mrsimulator package
    using pip.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install mrsimulator

If you get a ``PermissionError``, it usually means that you do not have the required
administrative access to install new packages to your Python installation. In this
case, you may consider using the ``--user`` option to install the package into your
home directory. You can read more about how to do this in the
`pip documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`_.

On Google Colab Notebook
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Colaboratory is a Google research project. It is a Jupyter notebook environment that
runs entirely in the cloud. Launch a new notebook on
`Colab <http://colab.research.google.com>`_. To install the mrsimulator package, type

.. code-block:: shell

      !pip install mrsimulator

in the first cell, and execute. All done! You may now start using the library.

.. _building_from_source:

Building from the source
------------------------

Prerequisites
'''''''''''''

You will need a C-compiler suite and the development headers for the BLAS and FFTW
libraries, along with development headers from Python and Numpy, to build the
``mrsimulator`` library from source.

The Mrsimulator package utilizes the BLAS and FFTW routines for computation. To
leverage the best performance from the mrsimulator library, we recommend installing the
BLAS and FFTW libraries, which are optimized and tuned for your system. In the following,
we list recommendations on how to install the c-compiler (if applicable), BLAS, FFTW,
and build the mrsimulator libraries.

Obtaining the Source Packages
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Stable packages
***************

The latest stable source package for ``mrsimulator`` is available on
`Github Releases <https://github.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator/releases>`_ and
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mrsimulator/#files>`_.

Development Repository
**********************

The latest development version of the ``mrsimulator`` can be cloned from
`Github <https://github.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator>`_.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Linux

    **OpenBLAS and FFTW libraries**

    On Linux, the package manager for your distribution is usually the easiest route to
    ensure you have the prerequisites to building the mrsimulator library. To build from
    source, you will need the OpenBLAS and FFTW development headers for your Linux
    distribution. Type the following command in the terminal, based on your Linux
    distribution.

    *For (Debian/Ubuntu):*

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev libfftw3-dev

    *For (Fedora/RHEL):*

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install openblas-devel fftw-devel


  .. tab:: Mac OSX

    **OpenBLAS/Accelerate and FFTW libraries**

    You will require the ``brew`` package manager to install the development headers for the
    OpenBLAS (if applicable) and FFTW libraries. Read more on installing brew at
    `homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_.

    **Step-1** By default, the mrsimulator package links to the openblas library for BLAS
    operations. Mac users may opt to choose the in-build apple's accelerate library. If you
    opt for apple's accelerate library, skip to Step-2. If you wish to link the mrsimulator
    package to the openblas library, install openblas using the `homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_
    formulae as follows,

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ brew install openblas

    **Step-2** Install the FFTW library using the `homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ formulae.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ brew install fftw

    **Step-3** If you choose to link the mrsimulator package to the OpenBLAS library, skip
    this step. Open the ``settings.py`` file, located at the root level of the
    mrsimulator folder, in a text editor. You should see

    .. code-block:: python

      # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
      # BLAS library
      use_openblas = True
      # mac-os only
      use_accelerate = False

    To link the mrsimulator package to the in-build apple's accelerate library, change the
    fields to

    .. code-block:: python

      # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
      # BLAS library
      use_openblas = False
      # mac-os only
      use_accelerate = True

  .. tab:: Windows

    .. include:: install-docs/windows.rst


Building and Installing
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the terminal/Prompt to navigate into the directory containing the
package (usually, the folder is named mrsimulator),

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd mrsimulator

and build and install ``mrsimulator`` using pip,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install .

If you get an error that you don't have the permission to install the package into
the default ``site-packages`` directory, you may try installing with the ``--user``
options as,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install . --user

----

Check your build
----------------

If the installation is successful, you should be able to run the following test
file in your terminal. Download the test file
`here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator-examples/master/test_file_v0.3.py?raw=true>`_.

.. code-block:: text

    $ python test_file.py

The above statement should produce the following figure.

.. figure:: _static/test_output.*
    :figclass: figure

----

Setup for developers and contributors
-------------------------------------

A GitHub account is required for developers and contributors. Make sure you have
git installed on your system.

**Step-A** (Optional) Create a virtual environment. It is a good practice to create
separate virtual python environments for packages when in developer mode.
The following is an example of a Conda environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -n mrsimulator-dev python=3.7
    $ conda activate mrsimulator-dev

**Step-B** Clone the mrsimulator repository using git and navigate into the package
folder.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator.git
    $ cd mrsimulator

**Step-C** Follow the instruction under :ref:`os_dependent_prerequisite` from
:ref:`building_from_source` section. For developers and contributors using mac OSX,
please run the setup by binding to the openblas libraries.

**Step-D** Build and install the package in the development (editable) mode using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e .

**Step-E**: Install the required packages for developers using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

As always, if you get an error that you donâ€™t have the permission to install the
package into the default site-packages directory, you may try installing by adding the
``--user`` options at the end of the statements in steps D and E.

Note for the developers and contributors
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Running tests**: For unit tests, we use the pytest module. At the root directory
of the mrsimulator package folder, type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest

which will run a series of tests.

**Building docs**: We use the sphinx python documentation generator for building docs.
Navigate to the ``docs`` folder within the mrsimulator package folder, and type,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make html

The above command will build the documentation and store the build at
``mrsimulator/docs/_build/html``. Double click the `index.html` file within this
folder to view the offline documentation.

.. **Submitting pull requests** Make sure all the test pass and the documentation build
.. is successful before creating a pull request.

.. We recommend the
.. following C-compiler for the OS types:
.. - Mac OS - ``clang``
.. - Linux - ``gcc``
.. - Windows - ``msvc`` (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)
