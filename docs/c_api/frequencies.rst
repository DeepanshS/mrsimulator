NMR Frequencies
===============

The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequency, :math:`\Omega(\Theta, i, j)`
for the :math:`i \rightarrow j` transition between the eigenstates of the
stationary-state semi-classical Hamiltonain, can be written as a sum of
frequency components,

.. math::
    \Omega(\Theta, i, j) = \sum_k \Omega_k (\Theta, i, j),

where :math:`\Theta` is the sample's lattice spacial orientation and
:math:`\Omega_k` is the frequency component from the :math:`k^\text{th}`
Hamiltonian.
