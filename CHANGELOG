v0.3.0
 - Renamed `decompose` attribute from the `ConfigSimulator` class to `decompose_spectrum`
 - Renamed `Dimension` class to `Method` class.
 - Renamed `Isotopomer` class to `SpinSystem`.
 - Renamed `isotopomers` attribute from Simulator class to `spin_systems`.
 - Renamed `dimensions` attribute from Simulator class to `methods`.
 - New classes for simulation the NMR spectrum. Two build-in methods,
   `BlochDecaySpectrum` and `BlochDecayCentralTransitionSpectrum`. The Bloch decay
   spectrum method simulates all p=Δm=-1 transition pathways, while the Bloch decay
   central transition selective spectrum method simulates all transition pathways with
   p=Δm=-1 and d=0.
 - Improved simulation performance.
 - Fixed bug resulting from the rotation of the fourth rank tensor with non-zero euler
   angles.
 - New `Isotope`, `Transition`, and `ZeemanState` class objects.
 - Every class now includes a `reduced_dict()` method.

v0.2.0
 - Added more isotopes to the simulator. Source NMR Tables (https://apps.apple.com/bn/app/nmr-tables/id1030899609?mt=12)
 - Added two new keywords: 'atomic_number' and 'quadrupole_moment'
 - Renamed the class Spectrum to Dimension
 - Added documentation for every class.
 - Added examples for simulating NMR quadrupolar lineshapes
 - Added amplitude normalization. The spectral amplitudes no longer change when
   integral_density, integral_volume, number of sidebands, or number of points
   along the dimension is changed.
 - Removed plotly-dash app to its own repository.

v0.1.3
    Fixed missing files from source tar.

v0.1.2
    Release on pypi.

v0.1.1
    - Added solid state quadrupolar lineshape simulation.
    - Added mrsimulator plotly-dash app.

v0.1.0
    - Solid state chemical shift anisotropy lineshape simulation
