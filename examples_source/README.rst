In this section, we use the ``mrsimulator`` tools to create spin systems and
simulations with practical/experimental applications. The examples illustrate

- building spin systems,
- simulating spectrum,
- spectrum processing (e.g., adding line-broadening), and
- using least-squares fitting packages with ``mrsimulator``.
