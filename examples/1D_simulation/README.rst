1D NMR simulation
-----------------

The following examples are the NMR spectrum simulation of a Bloch decay and Bloch decay
central transition selective signal for crystalline and amorphous materials. For NMR of
amorphous solids, we show examples of how to simulate spectrum using your model or using
commonly used models such as Czjzek or extended Czjzek.
