In this section, we use the mrsimulator tools to create isotopomers and
simulations with practical/experimental applications. The examples illustrate

- building isotopomers,
- simulating spectrum,
- spectrum processing (e.g., adding line-broadening), and
- using least-squares fitting packages with mrsimulator.
